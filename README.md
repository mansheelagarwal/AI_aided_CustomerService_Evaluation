This project was a part of my role as a Research Fellow at the World Research Union, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in which I evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in the sphere of customer service and satisfaction by analyzing the prompts gathered through an independent research via a Google Form. After recording the performance of the GPT model for every prompt, I enhanced its performance using techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and intent recognition to capture the crucial data as well as the sentiments of the customers. 

## Note to Viewers
Unfortunately, the code cannot be made public due to the inclusion of sensitive and private data of the customers. I am committed to making sure that the people who trusted me with their responses are done justice by keeping their information safe and secure.
