The objective would be to specifically look at how ChatGPT may improve consumer interactions with businesses. Data would be collected  from customer service interactions in a number of businesses to perform this research. The data will then be analyzed using ChatGPT to detect customer behavior and preferences trends. A ChatGPT-based model would be created for personalized customer support according to the results of this research. The results presented in this study might have far-reaching consequences for firms aiming to improve their customer services.
